# Web Page Project

This project implements a fully functional, responsive web page using only HTML and CSS. The page design is based on the Figma file created by *Nicolas Philippot* and demonstrates key concepts such as accessibility, responsive design, and semantic HTML structure.

# Features

1. - The web page automatically adjusts to different screen sizes.
   - Mobile version is activated when the screen width is *480px or less*.

2. - Hover/Active States:
     - *Links*: Change to `#FF6565` when hovered or active.
     - *Buttons*: Set to `opacity: 0.9` on hover/active.
   - Content is limited to a **maximum width of 1000px**, centered on the page.

3. - Semantic HTML elements for better readability.
   - Alt text provided for all images for accessibility.

4. - Fully implemented with HTML and CSS.
   - No JavaScript or frameworks like Bootstrap were used.
